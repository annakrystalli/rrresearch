# Session Roadmap

<br>

### 1 Introductions 


#### - **get to know github** 

  - github as a computational research tool

---

# Session Roadmap

<br>

### 2 Get stuck in


#### - [Collaborative github through rstudio](https://nhm-stars.github.io/materials/day04/evolottery.html) #EvoLottery (40 mins)
  - In this exercise, each participant will fork a github repo, and contribute a file required to simulate the **evolutionary trajectory of an imaginary species' body size**.
  
  - We'll use github to collate all species files and plot them all up together at the end! We'll also **discover the skull and beak shapes** associated with each simulated species size.

## **GitHub for science**

***


> - ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts.

> - supports peer review, commenting, and discussion. 

> - Diverse range of efforts, from individual to large bioinformatics projects, laboratory repositories, as well as global collaborations have found a home on GitHub

### **#EvoLottery**

**Beak and skull shapes in birds of prey (“raptors”) are strongly coupled and largely controlled by size.** 


  - In this exercise, each participant will **fork a github repo**, and **contribute a file** required to simulate the *evolutionary trajectory of an imaginary species' body size*.


  - We'll use **github** to **collate all species files** and **plot** them all up together at the end! We'll also **discover the skull and beak shapes** associated with each simulated species size.
