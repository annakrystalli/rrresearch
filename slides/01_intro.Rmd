### The paper is the advertisement


> “an article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the **full software environment, code and data, that produced the result.**”

*John Claerbout paraphrased in [Buckheit and Donoho (1995)](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf)*

### Lessons from the Reproducibility/Replicability crisis

- Many issues statistical and a results of broken Academic incentive systems.

- Much can be tackled by transparency and better computational literacy.

### [Reproducible Research in Computational Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226)
ROGER D. PENG, SCIENCE 02 DEC 2011 : 1226-1227

> Reproducibility has the potential to serve as a minimum standard for judging scientific claims when full independent replication of a study is not possible.

## **21st Century Research meta-responsibilities**

We need better digital curation of the workhorses of modern science: **code** & **data**

> **aim to create secure materials that are [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)**
> *findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable*

- Follow community conventions
- Prepare it to share it

## **Drivers of better digital management**


- Funders: value for money, impact, reputation

- Publishers: many now require code and data.
    + Specialist journals have emerged for:
      + **software**: [Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/), [MEE](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2041210x) 
      + **data**: [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/))
 
- PIs, Supervisors and immediate research group   

- Your wider scientific community

- The public

## **Yourselves!**

**Be your own best friend:**

### **Ultimately it's about getting a handle on our research materials**

## The concept of a Research Compendium

>“
...We introduce the concept of a compendium
as both a container for the different elements
that make up the document and its computations (i.e. text, code, data, ...), and as a means for distributing, managing and updating the
collection."

[_Gentleman and Temple Lang, 2004_](https://biostats.bepress.com/bioconductor/paper2/)

## Back to "Why are we here?"


- To help you make the most of the real workhorses of your work, **YOUR CODE & DATA**!

--

- We'll do this by introducing you to **useful data and software tools and best practices**.

--

- To help you be empowered by modern tools & technologies rather than be overwhelmed by them

--

- To help you lead the culture change rather than be burdened by increased requirements

--

- Ultimately, to **change how science works for better for everyone**!

## Course Outline

### Today

- Introduction
- Basic Data Hygiene
- Research Data Management - Metadata
- Literate Programming with Rmarkdown
- Version Control with Git

---

## Course Outline

### Tomorrow

- Collaborating through GitHub

# Before we dive in

- We'll exploring best practice in data and workflow management. I've tried to focus on concepts and tools that I wish I knew when I started


--

- We'll explore individual tools and concepts and show how they work nicely together.

--

- We'll also be working together through exercises. 

--

- We'll be using colour post it's to track progress at give time for folks to catch up at key stages using traffic lights thhroughout the materials `r emo::ji("vertical_traffic_light")`

--

- Feedback between sessions: After each session, let me know on your post-its:
  - `r emo::ji("green_book")`: somethind you liked
  - `r emo::ji("red_circle")`: somethind that could be improved

--

- Please feel free if I use jargon you don't understand or need some clarification.  Questions are helpful for everyone! `r emo::ji("sparkles")`
